      <p class="minor-title">Group Behaviors of Pandas</p>
      <p class="minor-info">Many animals have different lifestyles, foods, and behaviors. Because of the effects that natural mechanisms like evolution by natural selection have on animals, these behaviors in some way provide a benefit to the animal. As scientists, it’s our job to find the patterns within these behaviors and find out how they benefit the animal. Some animals, like Lions, hunt in groups to get the most out of their meals. Other animals, like Giant Panda Bears, live alone. Giant Pandas live in isolation because it provides the most benefit relative to their lifestyle. There are many reasons for this, but one of the most important is that they have an incredible sense of smell. According to <span class="link"><a href="https://www.britannica.com/animal/giant-panda">Britannica</a></span>, their “solitary nature is underscored by its reliance on its sense of smell (olfaction)” (Donald Linburg, 2020). These animals don’t have to rely on other members of their species, at least not after their early years, because of their great sense of smell. They’re able to leave scents to mark their territory and to tell others where they’ve been, and they can tell really easily where the territory is. Another reason for their solitary nature is that they can very easily find their food and that they don’t like to share. According to <span class="link"><a href="https://animalcorner.org/animals/giant-panda-bear/">animalcorner</a></span>, most pandas eat “as much as 20 to 30 pounds of bamboo shoots a day” (animalcorner, 2020). Not only do they not like to share, but they don’t need to rely on anyone else because the bamboo they need is all around them. Even though they can eat meat, they can’t catch any prey so there’s no need for them to live in packs. While they do live in solitary, however, they still live within the vicinity of other pandas. They usually live near other pandas and are friendly towards one another, but still tend to keep their distance. Past that, they don’t like interacting with any other pandas much at all. In fact, according to the <span class="link"><a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/giant-panda">Smithsonian</a></span>, pandas that are a part of “different ‘groups’ generally avoid socializing with each other” (Smithsonian, 2020). They don’t like socializing with one another because they are very territorial. When one gets near another one’s territory, they can smell the marks the other pandas have left and will almost immediately retreat. In this case, it’s more so about pandas having a sense of common courtesy to leave another’s home alone, being that they are not only scared of encroaching on someone else’s territory, but also being hurt because of it. There are many reasons why pandas live alone, and they have for a very long time. It’s a part of their nature, and it’s one of the things that their species evolved to do. Understanding that can not only help us understand diversity in nature, but also help us apply certain kinds of critical thinking to understand patterns and situations in real life.</p>

      <p class="minor-title">Biodiversity</p>
      <p class="minor-info">Ecosystems are completely reliant on the enviroments that they lie within. It's no surprise that when these environments change, the ecosystems change with them. We've already seen it in the past, and as it's happening now. Some of the choices in humanity in the past have caused mass habitat loss in the wild and led to global warming. Animals in any ecosystem, from the Arctic to the savannas of Africa, animals will change with their surroundings. Because they interact with them on a constant basis, the other fauna and flora in their ecosystem contribute to something that's hard to describe with words... but can be described with one: biodiversity. Biodiversity itself can be hard to explain. It's having lots of varieties of species within an ecosystem, it's having many different interacting parts that contribute to keeping the world a good place. When one animal or plant is threatened, whether it be that it's being poached by humans, or it's helped too much, being overconserved by humans, it can have a large impact on the entire ecosystem. Furthermore, it can have an impact on humans. The way we live is impacted by other living organisms. We use them for food, clothing, we domesticate them, and sometimes we have them as pets. Other organisms are important to keep alive, because once they're gone, <em>they're gone</em>. Animals and plants don't just evolve back into existence. We can't just Jurassic Park an animal back alive. Without biodiversity in different ecosystems, we lose life. But we don't just lose that. We lose an experience. It's important for us, as the one sentient species on this planet, to use our gift, our power over other species, as wisely as we can. Because, as cheesy as it may be, Uncle Ben was right. With great power comes great responsibility. It's our duty to use our power properly.</p>
