          <p class="minor-title">What are Pandas?</p>
          <p class="info">The <em>Giant Panda</em> (<em>Panda</em>, <em>Panda Bear</em>), with the scientific name <span class="link"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda"><em>A. melanoleuca</em></a></span>, is a bear species that lives in Asia, and more specifically China. They live in the mountains of central China, where the forest hasn't been torn down yet. They are considered a vulnerable species, thought to be primarily because of deforestation, where they are driven out of their homes. Even after the tons of conservation efforts being carried out, the Panda still remains endangered. This preservation is not unwarranted, however, as the Giant Panda is essential in its ecosystem.</p>

          <p class="minor-title">What Makes an Organism?</p>
          <p class="info">Panda bears, like many organisms, are alive. A living thing follows 6 characteristics (according to <span class="link"><a href="https://www.ck12.org/biology/Characteristics-of-Life/lesson/Characteristics-of-Life-Advanced-BIO-ADV/">ck12.org</a></span>): the ability to respond to external stimuli, the ability to grow and change, the ability to reproduce, having complex chemistry, being built of a complex structure known as the cell, and finally, the ability to maintain homeostasis. The long and short of it is, living things interact, adapt, evolve. These are all a necessity in a living organism. <br /><br /> While they eat bamboo and small animals like <span class="link"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_rat">Bamboo Rats</a></span>, that's not the limit of their reach, as they also coexist with other animals, like the <span class="link"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_panda">Red Panda</a></span>. </p>

          <p class="minor-title">Human Interaction</p>
          <p class="info">They also interact with their predators, like the <span class="link"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_leopard">snow leopard</a></span>. They may fight, they may run, they may hide. These are all interactions between these animals. Finally, they interact with humans. We're a problem for them, and we can be a solution. In the past, we've caused deforestation and habitat loss for many animals like the Giant panda. Efforts in recent years to counteract our mistakes have been led and have been largely successful. We brought back pandas from the brink of extinction, and they're getting better. They're a vulnerable species, which means we still have a ways to go, but really, overall, this teaches us a lot; humans have an enormous impact on everything else on this planet. We are not alone here, and we can be a force of good or evil. What we do with that power is up to us. That is why we're learning about these animals, and why I'm making this website about pandas. The power is in our hands and it's our job to use it well.</p>
