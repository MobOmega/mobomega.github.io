      <p>While I don't have a pet yet, I might get a dog in the near future.</p>
      <p>My sister is really campaigning for one.<br>
        My mom grew up with dogs and would be fine with it.<br>
        My dad was somewhat reluctant, but he's fine with dogs, as long as they don't shed.<br>
        My younger brothers and I would be really happy to get a dog.</p>
