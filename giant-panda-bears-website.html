      <p class="minor-title">What are Pandas?</p>
      <p class="info">The <em>Giant Panda</em> (<em>Panda</em>, <em>Panda Bear</em>), with the scientific name <em>A. melanoleuca</em>, is a bear species that lives in Asia, and more specifically China. They are considered a vulnerable species as I'm making this. They coexist with many other species. Today I'm going to be teaching you about them.</p>

      <p class="info">Panda bears are alive. They are living. At the beginning of Bio, we learned that a living thing follows 6 characteristics (according to <span class="link"><a href="https://www.ck12.org/biology/Characteristics-of-Life/lesson/Characteristics-of-Life-Advanced-BIO-ADV/">ck12.org</a></span>): the ability to respond to external stimuli, the ability to grow and change, the ability to reproduce and have offspring, having complex chemistry, being built of a complex structure known as the cell, and finally, the ability to maintain homeostasis. The long and short of it is, living things interact. They adapt. They evolve. These are all necessary to defining a living thing. Pandas don't just interact with their food. While they do eat bamboo and small animals like bamboo rats, they also coexist with other animals, like the Red Panda. </p>

      <p class="info">They also interact with their predators, like the snow leopard. They may fight, they may run, they may hide. These are all interactions between these animals. Finally, they interact with humans. We're a problem for them, and we can be a solution. In the past, we've caused deforestation and habitat loss for many animals like the Giant panda. Efforts in recent years to counteract our mistakes have been led and have been largely successful. We brought back pandas from the brink of extinction, and they're getting better. They're a vulnerable species, which means we still have a ways to go, but really, overall, this teaches us a lot; humans have an enormous impact on everything else on this planet. We are not alone here, and we can be a force of good or evil. What we do with that power is up to us. That is why we're learning about these animals, and why I'm making this website about pandas. The power is in our hands and it's our job to use it well.</p>
